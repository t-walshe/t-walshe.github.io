Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emergent machine learning paradigm that focusses on the systematic improvement of data to aid performance of models in downstream tasks, particularly in deployed systems (rather than just on standard benchmarks). The *Introduction to Data-Centric AI* course offered by MIT gives a broad overview of the topics that encompass DCAI.

This series provides working notes and exercises from MIT's Data-Centric AI (DCAI) course offered in January 2023. The [course webpage](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu) provides lecture material, recordings, and the details of lab assignments.
