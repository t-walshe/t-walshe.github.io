        <p>Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer, with a focus on NLP. Previously, I completed a DPhil (PhD) in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, researching applications of machine learning to understand problems in cybersecurity within businesses.</p>

        <p>On this website, I write up the personal projects that I've worked on in my free time. These are typically themed around applied NLP and Data-Centric AI.</p>

        <p>Posts for each project are organised into <a href="/series">Series</a> that will be updated over time (albeit rather slowly). The website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh">Bokeh</a>, and hosted using GitHub.</p>
